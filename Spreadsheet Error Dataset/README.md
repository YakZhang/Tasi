# Spreadsheet Error Dataset

The **Spreadsheet Error dataset** contains 70 spreadsheets from 8 categories, 291 worksheets and 3,072 missing formulas and formula errors (which are two types of popular spreadsheet errors). This is the dataset used by our ISSTA 2021 paper: **Semantic Table Structure Identification in Spreadsheets**.

This dataset includes three folders.

* Subject
* TasiErrorLabelTool
* Research Paper

## Subject

Folder `Subject` includes 70 spreadsheets from EUSES dataset (which is an open source spreadsheet dataset).

We also provide a statistical spreadsheet `Groundtruth and tool results.xls` to publish the groundtruth errors in each spreadsheet and the results of our approach and other six error detection tools (i.e., CUSTODES, CACheck, ExceLint, AmCheck, Excel internal detector and UCheck & Dimension).
