We provide two datasets and related materials of our ISSTA 2021 paper: **Semantic Table Structure Identification in Spreadsheets**.

* Table Structure Dataset
* Spreadsheet Error Dataset

## Table Structure Dataset

This dataset contains 50 spreadsheets and the corresponding table structure annotation information.

Folder `Spreadsheet` includes 50 spreadsheets from the internet.

We also provide the corresponding labeled table structures in folder`Annotation`. According to our labeling rules, the labelers have labeled 54 table structures for the 50 spreadsheets.

The details are shown in `README.md`.

## Spreadsheet Error Dataset 

Folder `Subject` includes 70 spreadsheets with 8 categories.

We also provide a statistical spreadsheet to publish the groundtruth errors in each spreadsheet and the results of our approach and other six error detection tools (i.e., CUSTODES, CACheck, ExceLint, AmCheck, Excel internal detector and UCheck & Dimension)

Folder `Label Tool` includes an Excel plugin which helps to label the groundtruth errors in spreadsheets.

The details are shown in `README.md`.

## Related Paper

Folder `Related Paper` includes the related paper to the dataset.
